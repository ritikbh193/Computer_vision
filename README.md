Computer Vision Object Detection Project
Welcome to the repository for the Computer Vision Object Detection project! In this project, we explore various techniques and algorithms in computer vision to detect and localize objects within images. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of object detection using computer vision techniques. We cover the following key aspects:

Data Preparation: We discuss how to gather and preprocess the dataset for training the object detection model.
Model Training: We train a deep learning model for object detection using popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the trained model using standard metrics and techniques.
Inference: We demonstrate how to perform inference on new images using the trained model to detect objects.
Project Structure
The project repository is structured as follows:

notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) where the project implementation is documented step by step.
data/: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the object detection model.
models/: This directory contains the trained models saved after training.
utils/: This directory contains utility scripts and functions used throughout the project.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and any additional information.
Requirements
To run the notebooks and execute the code in this project, you will need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Yolo5
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy
Pandas (for data manipulation, if necessary)
